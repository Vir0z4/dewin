*deWin* is a suite of **optimized** and **debloated** Windows ISOs. They can offer superior performance compared to standard Windows installations, as some of Microsoft's useless shenanigans that run in the background have been removed.

*deWin* is also better for **privacy**. All telemetry has been disabled. Automatic/promoted app installation, Feedback, as well as various "sending Microsoft diagnostic data" have also been disabled. OOBE has been modified, it does not force you to use a Microsoft account, and some useless privacy options have been removed. Some other things like "Search on Bing" in the search menu have also been disabled.

**For maximum privacy**, please disable "Automatic sample submission" in Windows Defender after installation.

### deWin Variants

*deWin* is available in 3 variants:

* Windows 10 Home 22H2 64-bit
* Windows 10 Professional 22H2 64-bit
* Windows 10 Professional Workstation 22H2 64-bit (Pro Workstation is an advanced version of Pro)

Windows 11 variants will be available in the future.
