*deWin* is a suite of optimized and debloated Windows ISOs. They also potentially offer superior performance compared to standard Windows installations, as most Microsoft's useless shenanigans that run in the background have been removed.

***deWin*** **is currently under development, and is expected to be available in autumn of 2022.**

## deWin Variants

*deWin* is available in 3 variants:

* Windows 10 Home 22H2 64-bit
* Windows 10 Professional 22H2 64-bit
* Windows 10 Professional Workstation 22H2 64-bit (Pro Workstation is an advanced version of Pro)

Windows 11 variants will be available in the future.

## Documentation

No special documentation is necessary for *deWin*. The installation process is no different from any other standard Windows ISOs.
