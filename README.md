# deWin
*deWin* is a suite of optimized and debloated Windows ISOs. They also potentially offer superior performance compared to standard Windows installations, as some of Microsoft's useless shenanigans that run in the background have been removed.

*deWin* is also better for privacy. All telemetry has been disabled. Automatic/promoted app installation as well as experimentation have also been disabled. Feedback, as well as various "sending Microsoft diagnostic data" have also been disabled. OOBE has been modified, it does not force you to use a Microsoft account, and some useless privacy options have been disabled. Some other annoying stuff like "Search on Bing" on the search bar has also been disabled.

***deWin*** **is currently under development, and is expected to be available in autumn of 2022.**
